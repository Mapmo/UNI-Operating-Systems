This repository contains tasks that I have done for my Operating systems course in FMI (on LINUX).

There are mainly programs written in C. Tasks beginning with [6-8] are tasks given by Aleksandar Velin (https://github.com/avelin/fmi-os-code).

There are also some experimental programs and shell scripts that are explained in their folders.
